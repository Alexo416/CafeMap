# Cafe Map â˜•

This is a website that allows users to find cafes in downtown Hamilton and sort them based on seating space. When a user clicks on a coffee mug icon, an info window appears displaying the cafe's name and address. Users can also use the geolocation feature to get directions to the selected cafe either by entering an address or tapping on the "Find My Location" button.
